        "*   **What is User-Based Collaborative Filtering?**\n",
        "    User-Based Collaborative Filtering recommends items to a user by identifying other users with similar preferences and suggesting items that those similar users liked but the target user has not yet seen or rated. It calculates similarity by comparing the rating patterns or interactions between users, typically using metrics like Pearson correlation or Cosine Similarity on the user-item matrix.\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **What is Item-Based Collaborative Filtering?**\n",
        "    Item-Based Collaborative Filtering recommends items that are similar to the items that the target user has previously liked or interacted with. It calculates similarity between items by comparing how different users have rated or interacted with pairs of items, often using Cosine Similarity or Adjusted Cosine Similarity on the item-user matrix.\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **What are the main differences between User-Based and Item-Based Collaborative Filtering?**\n",
        "    The main differences lie in their focus (finding similar users vs. finding similar items), how similarity is calculated (comparing rows vs. columns in the user-item matrix), scalability (Item-Based generally scales better with more users), stability (Item-Based similarities are often more stable), handling of sparsity (Item-Based can handle sparsity better), and how recommendations are explained. Item-Based CF is often preferred in large-scale systems due to better scalability and stability.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Data Analysis Key Findings\n",
        "\n",
        "*   The initial dataset contained missing values in the 'genre' (0.50%), 'type' (0.20%), and 'rating' (1.87%) columns, which were subsequently removed.\n",
        "*   The 'genre' feature was transformed into a numerical representation using TF-IDF vectorization, resulting in a matrix with 47 unique genre-related features for 12017 anime entries.\n",
        "*   A recommendation function was successfully implemented using cosine similarity on the TF-IDF genre features to find anime similar to a given title.\n",
        "*   The evaluation on the test set (using a relevance threshold of 7.5 rating) yielded an average Precision@10 of approximately 0.4351. This indicates that, on average, about 43.51% of the top 10 recommended anime were considered \"relevant\" based on the rating threshold.\n",
        "*   The calculation of Recall and F1-score was noted to be a simplified proxy based only on the recommended set due to the lack of true user relevance data for the test set, highlighting a limitation of this evaluation method without explicit user interactions.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Insights or Next Steps\n",
        "\n",
        "*   The current genre-based similarity model provides recommendations that are relevant in terms of genre, but incorporating other features like 'type', 'episodes', or user interaction data (if available) could potentially improve the relevance and diversity of recommendations.\n",
        "*   To get a more accurate evaluation of the recommendation system, integrating actual user rating data for a test set (if available) would allow for a standard calculation of Recall and F1-score and provide a better understanding of the system's performance in a real-world scenario.\n"
